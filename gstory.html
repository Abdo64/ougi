            <P>A couple of years ago, I was chatting in a group online when someone shared a game screen recording.</P>
            <P>It was Genshin Impact. I'd heard of it on YouTube but hadn't seen any gameplay.</P>
            <P>As soon as I saw it, I fell in love with its anime style and combat.</P>
            <P>However, I had limited internet, so I couldn't download it immediately.</P>
            <P>I waited a few weeks and watched videos and tutorials to prepare.</P>
            <P>When Klee's banner was released, I finally downloaded it and began my journey.</P>
            <P>I started doing reroll accounts to get an early 5-star and evantualy I got Mona my first ever 5star </P>
            <p>I was happy with her, and I loved her</p>
            <p>time-skipped to Version 1.1 and got Childe, one of my favorite characters back then. He was really fun to
                play. However, I had to delete the game because of my exams. Later, I traded the account with a friend
                for a new one that had both Childe and Klee.</p>
            <p>After a while, I came back during Version 1.2 for Albedo's banner and managed to get him. When Hu Tao
                came out, I got her as well, and she's still one of my favorite characters. Version 1.4 wasn't too
                exciting, but when Version 1.5 came out, I tried to pull for Zhongli's first rerun. Unfortunately, I
                lost the 50/50 and, frustrated, I deleted the game (biggest mistake).</p>
            <p>While in a group, I met someone who wanted to buy an account, so I sold mine to them. Almost a year
                later, in Version 2.5, I decided to come back, and some butterfly gave me another account (the one I
                currently use). However, the account only had Raiden and Klee, so it was a bit of a disaster at first.
            </p>
            <p>It was Kokomi's banner, and I pulled a single on the weapon banner—and to my surprise, I got the weapon,
                haha! In Version 2.6, during the Ayato/Venti banner, I lost the 50/50 on Ayato but got Venti at 4 pity
                LMAO.</p>
            <p>Then came the legendary Ayaka banner—it was finally my chance to get her, and I did it, and I was soo
                happy!</p>
            <p> In Version 2.7, which was the Chasm update, I pulled Yelan (this was also when I joined the Genshin
                group btw).</p>
            <p>Version 2.8 brought Klee's island, and I got Kazuha because I wanted to complete Ayaka's ideal team. In
                Version 3.0, I skipped Zhongli because I didn't have time to play but ended up getting Kokomi.</p>
            <p>This was when I started playing seriously, and I haven't quit since. The best part about this game is the
                amazing friends I've met along the way, and I'm grateful to have found my online family.</p>
